# EEP-LER: Living Emergence Reference & Filament Processor

**Vision:** To develop a Universal Emergence Intelligence Stack capable of characterizing, comparing, and projecting emergent phenomena across diverse domains. This repository focuses on the foundational components: the Living Emergence Reference (LER) and the EEP Filament processing engine.

**Current Focus: Sprint Zero - Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**

The primary goal of Sprint Zero is to establish the absolute minimal, functional core of the LER-Filament interaction. This serves as a proof-of-concept and provides the essential scaffolding for iterative development.

## Sprint Zero: Overview & Goals

Sprint Zero aims to deliver:

* **LER v0.0.1:** A version-controlled, machine-readable repository containing:
    * Core ontology schema.
    * 1-2 fully formalized Emergence Element Patterns (EEPs).
    * 1 formalized Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outline for characterization.
* **Filament v0.0.1:** A rudimentary, stateless processing script capable of:
    * Accepting a hardcoded query.
    * Dynamically accessing and parsing relevant definitions from LER v0.0.1.
    * Executing a single, highly simplified (stubbed) "analytical step" based on an LER SOP.
    * "Projecting" a minimal output.
* **Demonstrated Interaction Loop:** A successful demonstration of Filament accessing LER to produce an output for a specific, simple EEP-related task.

### Key Success Metrics for Sprint Zero:
‚úÖ **LER Repository:** Version-controlled, machine-readable structure.
‚úÖ **EEP Definitions:** 1-2 fully formalized EEPs with signature patterns.
‚úÖ **SOP Definition:** 1 working SOP analysis procedure outline.
‚úÖ **LER Access:** Programmatic library for LER data retrieval.
‚úÖ **Filament Engine:** Stateless processing with dynamic LER interaction.
‚úÖ **Complete Demo:** End-to-end workflow demonstration of the LER-Filament loop.
‚úÖ **Scaffolding:** A solid foundation for future iterative development and expansion.

## Core Components (Sprint Zero Implementation)

### 1. Living Emergence Reference (LER) v0.0.1
* **Purpose:** To serve as the externalized, machine-readable knowledge base of emergence patterns, definitions, and procedural guidance.
* **Key Tasks & Deliverables for Sprint Zero:**
    * **LER-1: Establish Repository & Core Schema:**
        * Git repository (`eep-ler`) with the defined directory structure.
        * `schemas/core_schema.yaml` defining the structure for EEPs, Signature Patterns, SOP Steps, etc.
    * **LER-2: Populate Minimal Viable Content:**
        * 1-2 formalized EEPs (e.g., 'Distributed Intelligence') in `eep_definitions/` compliant with `core_schema.yaml`.
        * 1 formalized SOP outline (e.g., 'Basic EEP Fingerprinting') in `sops/characterization/`.
    * **LER-3: Implement Basic LER Access Script:**
        * A Python script (`tools/ler_access.py`) to load, parse, and provide programmatic access to EEP and SOP definitions from the LER.

### 2. EEP Filament v0.0.1
* **Purpose:** To act as a stateless processing event engine that orchestrates analysis based on LER guidance.
* **Key Tasks & Deliverables for Sprint Zero:**
    * **FIL-1: Define Single Filament Event Scenario:**
        * A hardcoded query specifying an EEP, SOP, and SOP step for characterization (e.g., "Briefly characterize EEP_DISTRIBUTED_INTELLIGENCE based on SOP_BASIC_EEP_FINGERPRINTING, step STEP_2_SIGNATURE_SCANNING").
    * **FIL-2: Implement LER Interaction Logic:**
        * Filament script (`tools/filament_v001.py`) to parse the hardcoded query and use `ler_access.py` to fetch relevant EEP/SOP details from the LER.
    * **FIL-3: Implement Stubbed Analytical Tool & Basic Processing:**
        * A simple, hardcoded Python function (analytical stub) within Filament that simulates an analysis step (e.g., basic signature detection) using information from the LER.
    * **FIL-4: Minimal Output Projection & Stateless Confirmation:**
        * Filament prints a formatted string summarizing the event and its outcome.
        * Ensures clean termination/reset after the event, maintaining no persistent state related to the specific query.

## Running the Sprint Zero Demonstration

### Quick Start
1.  Ensure Python and `pyyaml` are installed (preferably in a virtual environment).
2.  Navigate to the `tools` directory:
    ```bash
    cd eep-ler/tools
    ```
3.  Run the Filament v0.0.1 script:
    ```bash
    python filament_v001.py
    ```

### Expected Output
The demonstration will show:
* LER Initialization: Loading schemas and definitions.
* Filament Event Creation: New stateless processing instance.
* Query Processing: Execution of the hardcoded analysis request.
* LER Data Retrieval: Dynamic access to EEP and SOP definitions.
* Stubbed Analysis: Simulated pattern detection.
* Output Generation: Formatted results with metadata.
* Stateless Cleanup: Confirmation of event termination without persistent state.

(See the detailed "Sample Results" section in the full Sprint Zero guide for an example.)

## Broader Framework Context: Universal Emergence Intelligence Stack

This Sprint Zero work establishes the foundational scaffolding for a more comprehensive **Universal Emergence Intelligence Stack**, envisioned with the following layers:

* üé® **USER INTERACTION & TASKING LAYER** (Future)
* üî• **EEP FILAMENT: Stateless Orchestration & Synthesis Core (THIS SPRINT - v0.0.1)**
* üìö **LIVING EMERGENCE REFERENCE (LER): Externalized Knowledge & Procedures (THIS SPRINT - v0.0.1)**
